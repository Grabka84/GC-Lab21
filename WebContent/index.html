    <p class = "content">Hey team! My name is Krzysztof ("Kris-tof"), or Krys for short. 
    I'll be posting my progress, thoughts, and struggles as I learn more coding and make 
    my transition into the tech industry. I'm excited to be making this leap into programming, 
    and while I have a lot to learn, I'm finding  the process extremely rewarding. </p>
